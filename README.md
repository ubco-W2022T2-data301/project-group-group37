## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

**Shawn**: The dataset is related to what I am currently doing, and have gone through a little myself.
I am most interested in how the education level and age of the person affects their adaptability.

**Darvesh**: I find this dataset interesting because I went through this during COVID and I want to know how someone's socioeconomic condition can affect their educational adaptability compared to being adaptable in general. I find that Gender, Age, Financial Condition, and the Location of the student affect the student's socioeconomic condition the most so I will be focusing on those aspects.

**Ahmad**: As a student myself, the most interesting experience I ever had in education is the online classes that were happening globally throughout the latest pandemic. This topic is one of the most relatable considering that I have been through it for almost 3 years. Besides, I did experience joining Zoom classes from 3 different devices (laptop, tablet and phone) with different internet type (wi-Fi and mobile data). Thus, these differences should somehow affects students' ability to adapt to their online classes.
