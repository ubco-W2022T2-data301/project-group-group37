    "Device and Internet Type columns caught my attention because different combinations of devices (Mobile, Tab & Computer) and internet type (Mobile data & Wi-Fi) result to different / similar adaptivity level of students. Thus, I am wondering if there are certain combinations of these components that result to \"High\" and \"Low\" adaptivity level the most. "
