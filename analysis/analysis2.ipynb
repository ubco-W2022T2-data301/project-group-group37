    "## How does the maturity level of students affect their adaptability to online learning\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Personally, I felt I became more interested in learning as I grew older, and especially when I entered collage where I am taking courses that are slightly more specialzed in topics I am personally interested about. This led me to wonder if different maturity level might affect how adaptable students are to online learning, and I plan to look for any correlation between age/education level and their adaptability to online learning. Firstly I would need a good way to define maturity. For example, should it be more based on age or education level? Besides, would other factors possibly play a part, such as gender? With that in mind, I can then compare how adaptable students are to online learning with some visualisation, possibly a box plot. "
