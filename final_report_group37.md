# Group 37: Students Adaptability Level in Online Education

## Introduction

This project is investigating multiple categorical variables that influence students from different backgrounds regarding their adaptivity level to online classes. As students ourselves, this issue is highly relatable as all three of us have been in that situation for almost 3 years due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Thus, it is important for us to see how different variables such as socio-economic status, device ownership, and maturity levels affect oneâ€™s adaptivity level to the online environment.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

This process might be tiring but it was worth the time because it allows us to discover which visualization answers the question the fastest and which one requires more work only to do the same task. Besides, it also happens that some of the visualizations are easier to get the punchline compared to the rest. For instance,...

## Question 1: How does someone's Socio-Economic Condition affect their Educational Adaptability? In particular, their Gender, Age, and Financial Condition

##### Q2
#### How does the maturity level of students affect their adaptability to online learning?
Firstly, in this data set there are two columns that pertain to a person's maturity level, age and education level, and it is assumed that as a person progresses in life, be it in terms of their age or education level, they can also be considered more mature.

From these two graphs we can see that there is a dip in adaptability levels of students who are within the 16-20 age groups and students in college.

From this heatmap of average adaptability levels for students dipping in the same areas shown previously in the two graphs. We can also see that students within the 16-20 age group are people in all 3 education levels and all have approximately the same amount of difficulty regardless of which education level they are at, and college students between the age of 21-25 seem to struggle the most.
From these graphs it appears that there is no direct correlation between students becoming more adaptable as they mature. However, when put into more context, the results would make more sense. Children under 16 usually have more guidance from their parents or guardians, which could make adapting easier, while people in the age group of 16-20 are usually being left to work independently for the first time, which could be a large hurdle to overcome, making adapting to the new environment more difficult.
